## Description
This application can be used by employees, business owners, and entrepreneurs to create a unique but simple logo for their business webpage and/or merchandise. It utilizes JavaScript and XML languages to create an SVG file for the user based on their responses to the required questions. The SVG file can then be downloaded and saved for future use, as it is compatible with most applications.
